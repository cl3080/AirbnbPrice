# Machine_Learning_Models_for_Airbnb_Yield_Prediction

Airbnb is a great platform that provides people online marketplace and service to arrange or offer lodging. As a travel enthusiast, Airbnb is always my first choice when I am planning a trip. By using filters such as location and room type, I can search for accomodations efficiently. Hosts need to provide details for their houses including prices. For potential hosts, I guess they must be very interested in how much they could earn from putting their houses on Airbnb. As far as I know, there is no such a model for predicting the yield of a new house on Airbnb. So, the object of this project is to build a machine learning model to help potential hosts have intuition about the yield of their listed houses.  

Fortunately, [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) has already aggregated all the publicly available informations from Airbnb site for public discussion. So, the dataset obtained from this website directly should be a good starting point for my machine learning model. In particular, I will the dataset collected in New York city compiled on 06 December, 2018. When selecting features for machine learning model, besides the variables provided in the datasets, the __featured photo__ on the listing's website and the __description__ of listing can be crucial for attracting more guests. So, I will analyze featured photos and text mining on the descriptions and add these two new features to improve the machine learning model. 

The project will be described as follows:
    1. Exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing.
    2. Feature engineering.
    3. Machine learning model.
    4. Model evaulation.
